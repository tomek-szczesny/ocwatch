OpenClock internet game watch

OpenClonk is a great game, but throughout recent years, sadly, it fell into obscurity. It's hard to find players for cooperative games, and most of the time online lobby is empty. But certainly, not always.

This is a simple bash script that periodically checks for online games of OpenClonk. It sends desktop notifications if state of the lobby changes, with a brief list of games and their statuses.
The script may be launched in background and will do its thing.

This script is for Linux only.
